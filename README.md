# About Project 
It's a frontend project working on The Rick & Morty API data.

- 20 characters are listed using the Rick and Morty API.
- The card includes name, gender, type and live information, avatar and last known location.
- Filter by gender and life status information on the page.
- Multiple filters can be applied at the same time.
- A new page opens with the Router where the character is clicked, and the same information on the character card and the names of the last 5 episodes can be displayed.
- Can return to the main page with the back button from the character detail page.
